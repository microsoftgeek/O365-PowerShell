	 Created by:   	Bradley Wyatt
	 Version: 	    1.0.0
	 Notes:
	The variables you should change are the SMTP Host, From Email and Expireindays. I suggest keeping the DirPath
	SMTPHOST: The smtp host it will use to send mail
	FromEmail: Who the script will send the e-mail from
	ExpireInDays: Amount of days before a password is set to expire it will look for, in my example I have 7. Any password that will expire in 7 days or less will start sending an email notification 

	Run the script manually first as it will ask for credentials to send email and then safely store them for future use.
	===========================================================================
	.DESCRIPTION
		This script will send an e-mail notification to users where their password is set to expire soon. It includes step by step directions for them to 
		change it on their own.

		It will look for the users e-mail address in the emailaddress attribute and if it's empty it will use the proxyaddress attribute as a fail back. 

		The script will log each run at $DirPath\log.txt
